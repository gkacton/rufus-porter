rp,"<b>Rufus Porter</b> was born in West Boxford, Massachusetts in 1792. 
  He spent much of his childhood in the Pleasant Mountain Gore, near what is now 
  Bridgton, Maine. As a young man, he attended Fryeburg Academy, worked as an
  apprentice shoemaker, spent time in the Militia during the War of 1812, and
  became a dancing master. <br>In 1815, Porter began his time as an itinerant 
  portrait painter. He traveled all around New England, painting inexpensive 
  portraits and making hollow-cut silhouettes. <br>By the 1830s, he had expanded his
  artwork to landscape mural painting, which is what he is mostly remembered for
  today. Porter's style consisted of clear colors, a chest-high horizon line, 
  distant mountains, and huge trees in the foreground. Porter is known to have
  directly taught at least two other muralists: his nephew, Jonathan D. Poor, 
  and his son, Stephen Twombly Porter. He also published instructions for his
  landscape mural painting style in his book <em>Curious Arts</em>."
jdp,"<b>Jonathan D. Poor</b> was born in Sebago, Maine in 1807. It is likely that
  Poor spent the 1820s travelling with his uncle, Rufus Porter, producing painted
  portraits and silhouettes. Based on the dated signatures he left, Poor worked 
  as a mural painter between 1830 and 1842, and likely learned the craft from
  his uncle, although he developed his own style. Poor's murals feature a greater
  variety of colors, detailed hillsides with orchards and fencing, and sumac
  shrubs and red birds in the foreground."
school,"<b>The Rufus Porter School</b> is the term applied to un-signed murals 
  painted in the style of Rufus Porter's murals. There are dozens, if not 
  hundreds, of Porter School murals in New England, which feature common Porter
  motifs, such as trees, fields, boats, and houses. It is likely that the 
  unknown painters of Porter School murals learned from Porter's instructions 
  in <em>Curious Arts</em>."
other,"<b>E.J. Gilbert</b> was a painter of Porter School murals. There is no 
  biographical information available about him, but it is known that Gilbert 
  painted and signed murals in the Knowlton House in Winthrop, ME, at 
  some time during the 1830s. The signature is stenciled, indicating that Gilbert
  planned to create and sign more murals; it is possible that other E.J. Gilbert
  murals have been covered by wallpaper or paint, and have yet to be uncovered.
  The style and motifs of Gilbert's mural indicate that he likely saw some of 
  Rufus Porter and/or J.D. Poor's murals in Maine, as he included images such as 
  red sumac, faux chair rails, and water scenes."
